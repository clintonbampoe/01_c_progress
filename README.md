# C Mastery Roadmap (K.N. King Edition)

This repository tracks my deep dive through *C Programming: A Modern Approach* by K.N. King. Itâ€™s structured to enforce clarity, modularity, and systems-level thinking. Each chapter is implemented with rigor, and every insight, bug, and refactor is documented through GitHub issues and markdown notes.

## ðŸ§­ Structure

- `chapters/`: Code organized by book chapters
- `insights/`: Deep dives into tricky or implementation-defined behavior
- `challenges/`: Stretch projects beyond the book to test mastery
- `roadmap.md`: Progress tracker with chapter breakdown
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: Template for learning tasks and bugs

## ðŸ§  Goals

- Build maintainable, modular C code
- Document learning tasks, bugs, and refactors
- Practice commit discipline and naming clarity
- Prepare for systems-level engineering workflows

## ðŸ›  Tools & Environment

- IDE: CLion, VS Code
- Build System: CMake
- Platform: WSL on Windows 11
- Git: granular commits, clean branches, tagged milestones
